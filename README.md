### Key Points:
- **Syntax Highlighting for Terminal Commands**: The `bash` syntax highlighting is applied to the commands, so they appear colorized in most markdown renderers like GitHub or GitLab. This makes the commands stand out more clearly.
- **Unified Setup Section**: The clone and navigate commands are now part of the same section, formatted appropriately for clarity.
